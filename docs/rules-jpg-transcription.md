## Multiplier Rules (from the table on the right side)

**12** - Double the number and add 5 if the neighbor is odd, and add "half" the neighbor.

**11** - Use "half" the neighbor, and add 5 if the number is odd.

**10** - First step: subtract from 10.
Middle steps: subtract from 9 and add the neighbor.
Last step: reduce left-hand digit of multiplicand by 1.

**9** - First step: subtract from 10 and double.
Middle steps: subtract from 9 and double, and add the neighbor.
Last step: reduce left-hand digit of multiplicand by 2.

**8** - First step: subtract from 10, and add 5 if the number is odd.
Middle steps: subtract from 9, and add 5 if the number is odd, plus 1 if the number is odd.
Last step: subtract from 5 and take "half" the left-hand of the multiplicand and reduce by 1.

**7** - First step: take 5 if the number is odd.
Middle steps: take "half" the neighbor and add 5 if the number is odd.
Last step: take "half" the left-hand digit of the multiplicand.

**6** - First step: subtract from 10 and double, and add 5 if the number is odd.
Middle steps: subtract from 9 and double, and add 5 if the number is odd, add "half" the neighbor.
Last step: take "half" the left-hand digit of the multiplicand and reduce by 2.

**5** - Double each digit of the multiplicand without carrying the neighbor at all.

**4** - Double the number and add the neighbor.
(In other words: if it is even, add "half" the neighbor, dropping fractions; if it is odd, add "half" the neighbor and 5.)

**3** - Copy down the multiplicand unchanged.

**2** - Zero times any number at all is zero.

**1** - Zero times any number at all is zero.

**0** - Zero times any number at all is zero.

## From the left page (partial text visible):

"SUMMARY"

[Some text about the method being useful for practice...]

"the number" - refers to the digit immediately above the place where the digit is being written

"neighbor" - refers to the digit to the right of "the number"

"Add 5 to..." - if it is even, add "half" the neighbor, dropping fractions; if it is odd, add "half" the neighbor and 5.
